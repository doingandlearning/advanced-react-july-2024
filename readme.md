## Aim

The aim of the workshop is to look at topics in React that are often overlooked in more beginner focused materials.

We want to make use of the whole array of hooks, make our own, understand how to optimise and test our code and have a clear view of what's coming up in React.

We may also have some time left over to explore other React adjacent topics that might be of interest.

   - useRef for DOM interaction
   - useReducer
   - useCallback
   - useLayoutEffect
   - useDebugValue

2. **Custom Hooks**

   - Developing custom hooks
   - Testing custom hooks

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Production performance management
   - Profiling components with React DevTools

4. **Testing React Apps**

   - Error boundaries

6. **React Suspense and Concurrent Mode**
